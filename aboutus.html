                    Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council (KENTTEC) is a state corporation mandated to coordinate all Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis eradication activities in Kenya. The Council was gazetted in July 2012 by the Government of Kenya as a successor to the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC).

                    The Council was formed to safeguard the gains made by PATTEC and to coordinate Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication activities to cover the whole country and subsequently, contribute towards the achievement of the Vision 2030 and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) no. 3 which aims promoting good health and wellbeing.

                     The Councilâ€™s secretariat is currently located in Nairobi at Crescent Business Centre 3rd floor, Parklands Nairobi opposite M.P. Shah Hospital.

                <h2> THE HISTORY OF KENYA TSETSE AND TRYPANOSOMIASIS COUNCIL(KENTTEC) </h2>
                <p class="p_one">
                    Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council (KENTTEC) is a state corporation mandated to coordinate all tsetse and trypanosomiasis eradication in Kenya. KENTTEC is the successor of Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) in Kenya. The continental campaign (PATTEC) was formed following the African Heads of State and Governments in 2000 in Lome, Togo declaration (Decision AHG/156 (XXXVI) of the 36th Assembly of Heads of State and Government) to free Africa from tsetse and Trypanosomiasis constraint.

                    The PATTEC initiative came to fruition in Burkina Faso in October 2001 with the subsequent establishment of the PATTEC coordination unit at the Commission of the African Union, Addis Ababa Ethiopia to implement the plan of action. Kenya is among the first group of 6 countries namely (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya Mali and Uganda) to implement the PATTEC project through funding from African Development Bank and the Government of Kenya.

                    In Kenya, the total tsetse infested area is about 138,000 Km2,which translates to 38 out of 47 counties. Eleven million people in endemic areas are at risk of sleeping sickness infection. In animals trypanosomiasis causes abortions, loss of milk, loss of draught power and therefore threatens livelihoods.

                     Nearly 11 million people are at risk of human sleeping sickness outbreak in the Lake Victoria ci basin and the Mara- Serengenti ecosystem. Tourism accounts for 21% of foreign exchange earnings; this sector is negatively affected by tsetse and trypanosomiasis. A reported case of sleeping sickness results in travel advisories, low tourist numbers leading to a loss in tourism revenue

                    <p class="p_two">PATTEC in Kenya was launched in 2005 with the goal of contributing to improved food security and poverty reduction in the tsetse infested areas. The objective was to to create sustainable tsetse-and- trypanosomosis-free areas by integrating suppression, control and eradication approaches while ensuring the reclaimed areas are sustainably, equitably and economically exploited.

                    PATTEC phase one, which ended in 2012 targeted tsetse eradication in 24,000 Km2 spread out three project areas namely Meru/Mwea, Lake Victoria and Lake Bogoria basins regions.

                    To safeguard the PATTEC achievements the government established the Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council (KENTTEC) through Legal Notice No. 77 of July 2012 under the State Corporations Act (Cap 446) whose mandate is to coordinate eradication of tsetse in the country, set standards and mitigate the socio-economic constraints brought by T&T infestation and assume the role previously undertaken by PATTEC.</p>

                <p>
                    Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) was formed following the African Head of State and Government in 2000 in Lome, Togo following a declaration (Decision AHG/156 ( XXXVI) of the 36th Assembly of Head of State and Government). The Secretary General of the AU was charged with the task of initiating a campaign to eradicate the Trypanosomiasis and Tsetse flies menace from the African continent, once and for all.

                    Since the launch of PATTEC, Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis problem has become more visible and all the affected countries have embarked on suppression  to suppress with an ultimately eradication goal.

                    The coordination office is based at African Union(AU) commission in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
